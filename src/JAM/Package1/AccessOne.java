//  Default - when you don't explicitly state it so it's using default Only the package
//  Public - Pretty much the same as default, but you explicitly state it. Every where.
//  Private - only the class it's written in can access the properties, or method... Only the file.
//  Protected - Can only access if related, so in the same package and if it's accessed through a subclass.
